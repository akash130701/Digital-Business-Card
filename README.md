Hey! Akash here. This is just a small personal project from my side. Took me a good 2 days to build(still learning :)). This is actually inspired from Bob Ziroll's Learn React For Free course.
A few things:
You can download this folder as a ZIP, and extract it to your system. After all that, head over to Terminal and run the following commands:
1. npm install
2. npm run build
NOTE: Make sure you've installed Node.js and NPM.
And then I used Netlify to deploy the app.

P.S: I've used <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> instead of <></> because I worked with React17 on this one and for some reason, I wasn't able to build the modules until I made this change.
